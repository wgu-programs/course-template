# Competency 1
Welcome to "Underwater Basket Weaving 101," where the improbable meets the impractical in a splash of academic rigor! This course dives deep into the history, theory, and hands-on practice of weaving baskets, submerged in our state-of-the-art aquatic labs. Prepare to get your feet (and everything else) wet as we explore various water-resistant materials and master the art of holding your breath while crafting. Through lectures that are just as likely to include mermaid folklore as they are the tensile strength of seaweed, students will emerge not just with soggy syllabi but possibly, a profound appreciation for waterproof crafting.
